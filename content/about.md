HELLO PASSERS-BY

This is the [**very first blog**](https://luominrui-tanya.netlify.app) i created on Augest 8th in 2020, using the very first computer language i learned for the past month. 


THANKS for a special FRIEND also my guide ( 老大哥 😄 ) who taught me about R and other stuff. And This is his [**Github page**](https://github.com/jmxsy2016) ( for some learning economics and want to discuss)


CURRENTLY, i am a undergraduate majoring in clinical medicine, just setting foot in programming  (小白🦉). Choosing R is because it can be used for bioinformatics, but i surprisly discovered other daliy usages.

Perhaps i will keep on going in bioinofrmatics and programming, when i realise R and others are beautiful languages.

This blog is created using [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package.
The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
